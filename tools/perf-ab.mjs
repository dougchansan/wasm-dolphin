// Paired A/B performance comparison.
//
// Why this exists: single-run comparisons on this project are worthless. The
// same title measured 32-35% early in a session and 26-28% later on
// byte-identical builds, and within-config spread on one binary was 26-35%.
// A 1-2% optimisation cannot be seen through that, which made micro-
// optimisation unfalsifiable rather than merely hard.
//
// What fixes it is not more runs -- it is PAIRING. Run A and B back-to-back as
// a pair, compute the difference WITHIN each pair, then take the median of the
// differences. Machine drift moves both halves of a pair together and cancels;
// only the treatment effect survives. Group means do not have this property,
// which is why the earlier A/B tables were misleading.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/perf-ab.mjs --filter "Metroid Prime (USA)" \
//     --a "" --b "DISABLE=0x800000" --pairs 5 [--duration 40]
//
// --a and --b are space-separated ENV assignments applied to boot-matrix. The
// only difference between the two arms should be the thing under test.
